# Project_number_1
First project


# Draft to get use started...
Use data from here:
https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

1. Clean data. (Does it need to be cleaned?)

a. pie chart by user type (customer and susbscriber)
b. Most/least populer station both start and end stations.
    1. Outliers?  One station with the significantly the most usage?

Output should be a cleaned file that can be used for analysis

2. Analyizations:
b. average duration per ride (are trips shorter/longer based on time of year)
c. average duration by member/non member
d. was there any one bike (id) that had the longest or shortest duration (outlier)
e. Add in map reflecting start of stop locations (as lat/log data is already included)

 # perhaps add in weather data as a comparison - is there a correlation between weather and duration, or number of trips?
